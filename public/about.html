                        <p>The Iowa City Tenants began as a project of the Iowa City Democratic Socialists of America.
                        In their work toward a more just and equitable world, the IC DSA took housing justice on as their major focus in 2018.
                        They began knocking on doors in our community and talking with people about their housing concerns. It became clear
                        that renters in Iowa City felt they had no voice or power in their housing situations and there was strong community
                            support for a tenants' union. Iowa City Tenants Union was founded in June of 2019 after a year of canvassing and hundreds of doors knocked. </p>

                        <p>Iowa City Tenants Union is now its own entity but we continue to be active in our community.
                            We have elected a board and officers, passed by laws and develop campaigns. ICTU holds general meetings every month,
                            in addition to working group meetings. We have on-going educational campaigns to inform tenants of their rights and
                            how to best protect themselves from underhanded landlords. We have counseled dozens of tenants in one-on-one meetings
                            on how to resolve maintenance issues, and get their landlords to respond to their complaints. We have recouped thousands
                                of dollars of unfairly held rental deposits.</p>

                        <p class= "">The purpose of the Iowa City Tenants Union is to organize tenants in Johnson County, Iowa in order to advance their collective interests.
                        This includes, but is not limited to: rendering mutual aid to one another, petitioning landlords, opposing the interests of landlords,
                        defending the political interests of tenants, and working for the advancement of the political interests of tenants.
                        </p>
                    <p class= "">The methods of the ICTU are democratic, non-hierarchical, grounded in tenant and community solidarity, and aimed toward empowering tenants
                        and securing safe and stable housing for all. The ICTU rejects discrimination on the basis of socioeconomic status, financial means, race,
                        nationality, dis/ability, gender, ethnicity, geographical origins, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status,
                        and any other aspect of personal identity.
                        </p>
                    <p class= "">ICTU believes the power imbalance between tenants and landlords leaves us no choice but to organize ourselves and work together toward our
                        own best interests. Because of this, membership in the union is limited to tenants who are not also landlords, property managers, leasing agents
                        or law enforcement officers. Non-tenants who meet all other criteria are welcome and encouraged to join as allies. ICTU does not collect dues,
                        instead encouraging participation in union activities.
